/*
Imagine you are tasked with developing a simple banking system for a local financial institution. The
bank has observed an increase in customer complaints regarding unclear transaction records and
unhandled errors during operations. They want a robust software module to manage bank accounts
efficiently while maintaining a log of transactions.
As a software developer, your job is to create a banking system with the following features:
1. A way to represent individual bank accounts, including the ability to manage their balances.
2. Secure methods to deposit and withdraw funds.
3. An error-handling mechanism to address invalid operations, such as attempting to withdraw more
than the account's current balance.
4. A feature that logs every function call when an error occurs to provide insights into the issue.
The bank also insists on maintaining a history of transactions using basic data structures without
relying on advanced libraries or containers. Design and implement a banking system that fulfills the
above requirements.
