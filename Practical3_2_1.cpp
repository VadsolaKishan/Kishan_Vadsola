/* A software development company was tasked with conducting a performance analysis of recursive 
algorithms versus their iterative counterparts. The specific focus was on calculating the sum of 
integers in an array, where the array's size and elements were to be provided dynamically by the user. 
To facilitate memory management and enable dynamic resizing of the array, the team decided to use 
a flexible container for storing the array elements. 
The system was designed to first prompt users for the array's size and then request the input of 
individual elements. A recursive function was to be implemented to compute the sum by dividing the 
problem into smaller sub-problems, recursively summing subsets of the array until reaching the base 
case. In addition to the recursive implementation, an iterative version of the function would be 
created for comparison. 
The main objective of the study was to assess and compare the computational performance and 
implementation complexity of both recursive and non-recursive approaches. By evaluating execution 
times, memory usage, and code complexity, the team hoped to gain insights into the trade-offs 
between recursion and iteration, particularly in terms of efficiency and applicability to real-world 
problems. */
