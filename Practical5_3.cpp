/* A team of software developers was tasked with creating a graphical simulation where operations on 
2D points play a crucial role. To facilitate this, they designed a class Point that encapsulates the 
coordinates ùë• and ùë¶. The class provides flexibility through overloaded operators to manipulate points 
efficiently. The unary operator - is overloaded to negate the coordinates of a point, while the binary 
operator + enables the addition of two points. Additionally, the equality operator == is overloaded to 
compare whether two points have identical coordinates. 
The development process required performing various operations between multiple points. To 
manage these operations effectively, a mechanism was needed to track and potentially undo them. 
This challenge prompted two approaches: using a ready-made dynamic stack structure or building a 
custom stack implementation. By managing a sequence of operations in reverse, the stack-based 
design allowed for a systematic undo capability, crucial for simulations involving iterative adjustments. */
